# Crowd-Counting-in-Public-Spaces-Using-CSRNet

In this project, my team and I developed a deep learning model to estimate crowd density in images captured from surveillance cameras. Accurate crowd counting is critical for managing large events, preventing overcrowding, and ensuring public safety. The project uses CSRNet, which combines a VGG-16 feature extractor and dilated convolutional layers, to generate density maps and predict the total number of people in each scene.
The goal was not only to provide reliable crowd estimates but also to support city planners in optimizing event management, improving evacuation planning, and enabling data-driven smart city decisions.
